# online simple code player
this is a simple code player.
in order for it to run, you need to download jquery and use the links referred inside (and change it according to your system).
read the comments inside the html file for more information.

note - do no run it on online servers since this files use eval(), which is indeed a dangerous thing to run cause of security reasons.
